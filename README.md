The model uses the dataset from TensorFlow to predict the length of the abalone using variables in the table. 
The model consists of three dense layers with 256 neurons each, using the sigmoid activation function for the first two layers and the linear activation function for the output layer.
Compile the model with the Adam optimizer, mean squared error loss function, and mean absolute error as the evaluation metric
